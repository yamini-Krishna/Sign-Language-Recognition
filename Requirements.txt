## Libraries Used

- TensorFlow: To build and train your neural network model for sign language recognition.
- Keras: High-level API for building deep learning models, integrated with TensorFlow.
- Streamlit: For creating the web app to display predictions and interact with users.
- OpenCV-Python: For image processing tasks, like resizing and handling hand gesture images.
- Numpy: To handle arrays and numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation (if you're working with structured data or CSVs).
- Matplotlib: To visualize data and model performance (if needed).
- Scikit-learn: Useful for additional ML utilities like train-test splits or metrics.
- Pillow: A Python Imaging Library to process image data.

You can add more libraries if required based on your project's additional needs. To install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`, users can run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
