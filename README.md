### **Objective of the Project:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate **Sign Language Recognition System** using **Deep Learning** techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This system aims to bridge the communication gap between deaf and mute individuals and the general public by recognizing hand gestures and converting them into text or speech.

By automating the process of recognizing sign language, the project seeks to:

1. **Enhance Communication**: Provide a tool that allows non-sign language users to interact with deaf and mute individuals easily.
2. **Improve Accessibility**: Enable people with hearing or speech disabilities to express themselves freely in public spaces.
3. **Promote Inclusivity**: Create a more inclusive environment where everyone can communicate effortlessly, breaking down communication barriers.
4. **Demonstrate Technological Integration**: Showcase how machine learning and computer vision can be integrated with everyday applications to assist marginalized communities.

### **Statistics on Sign Language Users and Deaf/Mute Population:**

1. **Deaf and Mute Population**: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over **5% of the world’s population** — or **430 million people** — have disabling hearing loss. Among them, a significant portion are also mute (unable to speak), although exact numbers vary by region.
   
2. **Sign Language Users**: There are approximately **70 million deaf people** worldwide, and a large percentage of them use **sign language** to communicate. The specific sign language used can vary by country or region, with different countries having distinct sign language systems (e.g., American Sign Language, British Sign Language, Indian Sign Language).
   
   - In the **United States**, around **500,000 to 2 million people** use American Sign Language (ASL).
   - In **India**, **around 18 million people** are estimated to have some form of hearing disability, and a significant portion uses Indian Sign Language (ISL) for communication.
   
Sign language remains a crucial tool for individuals who are deaf or mute, and projects like this aim to reduce the communication gap between them and those who do not know sign language.
