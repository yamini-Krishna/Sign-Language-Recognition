This paper presents an in-depth exploration of deep learning methodologies for hand sign
recognition, highlighting its significance in improving communication accessibility for individuals
with hearing impairments and enabling natural interaction with machines. The challenges
associated with hand sign recognition, such as variations in hand shapes, orientations, and
environmental factors like background clutter and lighting, are discussed. The paper also addresses
the communication gap between the hearing impaired and others, emphasizing the need for realtime interpretation of sign language. Previous approaches to address this challenge had limitations,
particularly in real-time interpretation. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a realtime hand sign language detection system capable of recognizing a wide range of hand signs,
including Indian alphabet sign language. The system utilizes OpenCV, various Python libraries,
and the TensorFlow object identification API. Data collection for training the model was
conducted using a camera and OpenCV, resulting in a diverse and extensive dataset to enhance the
model's accuracy. In conclusion, the paper presents a trained model capable of interpreting hand
signs captured through a camera in real-time, thereby facilitating communication between
individuals using sign language and others
